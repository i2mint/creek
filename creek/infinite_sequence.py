    The target ``y`` interval is expressed only by it's bounds, but we don't know if these are
     inclusive or not. The ``below_bt`` and ``above_tt`` allow us to express that by expressing how below the
     lowest (bt) bound and what higher than highest (tt) bound are defined.

    The function is meant to be curried (partial), for example:

    >>> from functools import partial
    >>> from operator import le, lt, ge, gt
    >>> default = simple_interval_relationship  # uses below_bt=ge, above_tt=lt

    No matter what the function is, they will always agree on any intervals that don't share any bounds.

from typing import Iterator


# TODO: Add some mechanism to deal with ITERABLE instead of just iterator. As it is we have some unwanted behavior with
#   iterables
@dataclass
class InfiniteSeq:
    """A list-like (read) view of an unbounded sequence/stream.

    For example, take an iterator that cycles from 0 to 99 forever:

    >>> from itertools import cycle
    >>> iterator = cycle(range(100))

    Let's make an InfiniteSeq instance for this stream, accomodating for a view of up to 11 items.

    >>> s = InfiniteSeq(iterator, buffer_len=11)

    Let's ask for element 15 (which is the (15 + 1)th element (and should have a value of 15).

    >>> s[15]
    15

    Now, to get this value, the iterator will move forward up to that point;
    that is, until the buffer's head (i.e. most recent) item contains that requested (15 + 1)th element.
    But the buffer is of size 11, so we still have access to a few previous elements:

    >>> s[11]
    11
    >>> s[5:15]
    [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

    But if we asked for anything before index 5...

    >>> s[2:7]  #doctest: +SKIP
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    OverlapsPastError: You asked for slice(2, 7, None), but the buffer only contains the index range: 5:16

    So we can't go backwards. But we can always go forwards:

    >>> s[95:105]
    [95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    You can also use slices with step and with negative integers (referencing the head of the buffer)

    >>> s[120:130:2]
    [20, 22, 24, 26, 28]
    >>> s[120:130]
    [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
    >>> s[-8:-2]
    [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]

    but you cannot slice farther back than the buffer

    >>> try:
    ...     s[-20:-2]
    ... except OverlapsPastError as e:
    ...     msg_text = str(e)
    >>> print(msg_text)
    You asked for slice(110, 128, None), but the buffer only contains the index range: 119:130

    Sometimes the source provides data in chunks. Sometimes these chunks are not even of fixed size.
    In those situations, you can use ``itertools.chain`` to "flatten" the iterator as in the following example:


    >>> from creek.infinite_sequence import InfiniteSeq
    >>> from collections import Mapping
    >>>
    >>> class Source(Mapping):
    ...     n = 100
    ...
    ...     __len__ = lambda self: self.n
    ...
    ...     def __iter__(self):
    ...         yield from range(self.n)
    ...
    ...     def __getitem__(self, k):
    ...         print(f"Asking for {k}")
    ...         return list(range(k * 10, (k + 1) * 10))
    ...
    >>>
    >>> source = Source()
    >>>

    See that when we ask for a chunk of data, there's a print notification about it.

    >>> assert source[3] == [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]
    Asking for 3

    Now let's make an iterator of the data and an InfiniteSeq (with buffer length 10) on top of it.

    >>> from itertools import chain
    >>> iterator = chain.from_iterable(source.values())
    >>> s = InfiniteSeq(iterator, 10)

    See that when you ask for :5, you see that chunk 0 is requested.

    >>> s[:5]
    Asking for 0
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    If you ask for something that's already in the buffer, you won't see the print notification though.

    >>> s[4:8]
    [4, 5, 6, 7]

    The following shows you how InfiniteSeq "hits" the data source as it's getting the data it needs for the request.

    >>> s[8:12]
    Asking for 1
    [8, 9, 10, 11]
    >>>
    >>> s[40:42]
    Asking for 2
    Asking for 3
    Asking for 4
    [40, 41]
